This wrapped token increases the interoperability of Ether by making it usable on ERC-20 compatible blockchains. The value of 1 WETH is equivalent to 1 Ether, and you can get the same amount of Ether back by exchanging them for your WETH.\n\nThe need for WETH arose because the native token of Ethereum, Ether, was created before the ERC-20 standard. This means that Ether is not ERC-20 compatible and cannot be exchanged directly for tokens on the blockchain. To trade it in a decentralised manner, a trusted third party or complex technical implementations were needed.\n\nWETH is used to swap between tokens on decentralised apps and can also be used on multiple blockchains. For example, you can convert Ether to WETH and then to Tether, which can be used on blockchains like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin, TRON, EOS, etc. This allows for diversification of investment and easy liquidation of assets.\n\nIn addition to trading and investment, WETH can also be used for payments and to pay gas fees on the Ethereum blockchain. Furthermore, one can earn by lending their WETH in a liquidity pool, and some decentralised finance protocols even offer rewards for participation.\n\nWrapping your Ether coins to WETH is a simple process that can be done using an Ethereum-compatible crypto wallet. You can visit an Ethereum-based decentralised exchange platform like Uniswap, connect your wallet and convert your ETH to WETH. This process helps you to avoid the high gas fees of Ethereum and save transaction time.\n"}, {"chain": "ethereum", "chainId": 1, "tokenAddress": "0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F", "token": "DAI", "tokenName": "Dai Stablecoin", "tokenNameLower": "dai stablecoin", "tokenURI": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustwallet/assets/master/blockchains/ethereum/assets/0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F/logo.png", "tokenDescription": "Dai (DAI) is a stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain that aims to maintain its value as close to one US dollar as possible through a system of smart contracts and decentralized participants. The stablecoin is maintained and regulated by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) made up of the owners of its governance token, MKR. Dai is created through an overcollateralized loan and repayment process facilitated by MakerDAO's smart contracts in the form of a decentralized application. Users can deposit Ether or other accepted cryptocurrencies as collateral, and borrow newly generated Dai against the value of their deposits. The collateralization ratio for Ether is currently set at 150%, meaning a depositor of $150 worth of Ether can borrow up to 100 Dai. If the collateralization ratio falls below the minimum ratio, anyone can call a function on the contract to liquidate the loan and receive a percentage of the collateral as a reward. Upon repayment of the loan and its accrued interest, the returned Dai is automatically destroyed and the collateral is made available for withdrawal. By controlling the types of accepted collateral, minimum collateralization ratios, and interest rates for borrowing or storing Dai, MakerDAO can control the amount of Dai in circulation and its value. The power to propose and implement changes to these variables is granted to holders of the MKR token, who can vote on proposed modifications in proportion to the amount of tokens they hold. MKR also serves as an investment in the MakerDAO system, with added interest used to buy and burn MKR tokens, making them permanently deflationary.\n"}, {"chain": "ethereum", "chainId": 1, "tokenAddress": "0xE41d2489571d322189246DaFA5ebDe1F4699F498", "token": "ZRX", "tokenName": "0x Protocol Token", "tokenNameLower": "0x protocol token", "tokenURI": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustwallet/assets/master/blockchains/ethereum/assets/0xE41d2489571d322189246DaFA5ebDe1F4699F498/logo.png", "tokenDescription": "0x is a decentralized exchange for trading ERC 20 tokens, which are digital assets built on the Ethereum blockchain.

It will also drive the transition to Ethereum Layer-2. In the previous version of the protocol (v3.1), protocol fees went to LRC stakers who locked up tokens for a minimum of 90 days. However, the new token model rewards LRC holders who use their assets productively for the good of the platform.\n\nProtocol fee distribution is configurable by the forthcoming Loopring Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), but will initially be distributed to participants in the following manner: LRC liquidity providers, insurers, and voters who participate in the success of the Loopring Layer-2 network. The new token model also represents a significant user experience improvement as it means no wasting money and time entering staking contracts on Layer-1, nor claiming your rewards.\n\nIn addition, on the Loopring Layer-2 network, there are no gas fees that can swing wildly. Instead, there are small percentage fees for trades or swaps, or small flat fees for transfers or withdrawals. These fees are less dependent on gas prices, providing users with a smoother experience, never paying massive surges and never waiting for confirmations when the network is congested.\n\nIn conclusion, the new token model for LRC aims to align the token's incentives with the overall success of the Loopring ecosystem, and improve the user experience by distributing rewards on Layer-2 and eliminating the need for gas fees.

The main purpose of the project is to offer computational power for all sorts of projects to users that don\u2019t have enough computing capacity.\n\nGolem allows users to sell their excess computing power to users who lack the resources to work on complex projects that require greater computational power for execution. Users who sell their resources are rewarded with GLM tokens in exchange for their service, paid by buyers on the network. The price depends on the amount of rented computational power.\n\nThe Golem network works by processing requests and connecting buyers and sellers based on the request in question. On the Golem\u2019s Network, users who buy computing power are known as Requestors. Requestors can create requests that the Golem system then processes, validates, and uses to connect the Requestor with appropriate resources. The system splits the task into smaller fractions of the initial task and rents the computing power from multiple users in portions.\n\nGolem effectively provides a P2P market for computing resources by splitting tasks into smaller portions so the system can scale properly and form a unique user-dependent market. GLM is the utility token of the Golem network and it serves as the main store of value on the network.

The protocol aims to offer a cost-efficient, secure, and reliable solution that can meet the high demand for video streaming today. The network\u2019s native token is the Livepeer Token (LPT).\n\nThe protocol distributes video transcoding work throughout its decentralized network. Video transcoding refers to the reformatting of a video to suit a variety of bandwidths and devices. The process is designed to make streaming more reliable while reducing costs. Livepeer acts as a decentralized marketplace for developers building applications that integrate live video and transcoding providers.\n\nThe protocol aims to reduce costs up to 50x compared to legacy methods by using a decentralized, token-incentivized, and open network to replace the traditional model. Nodes called Broadcasters send video streams to the network for transcoding. These streams are received by Orchestrators, who contribute their computer\u2019s CPU, GPU, and bandwidth to the network in exchange for fees denominated in ether (ETH) charged to Broadcasters.\n\nThe network utilizes a two-layer consensus mechanism. First, the Livepeer ledger and its transactions are recorded on and secured by the Ethereum blockchain. The second consensus layer handles the distribution of newly generated LPT and verifies that transcoding work has been done correctly. This layer utilizes a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) model in which Orchestrators act as validators, ensuring proper payment settlement, token distribution, and security.\n\nIn summary, Livepeer is an Ethereum-based protocol that offers decentralized infrastructure for video streaming, utilizing a decentralized network, a native token (LPT), and a two-layer consensus mechanism to provide cost-efficient, secure, and reliable solution for today's high demand for video streaming.\n"}, {"chain": "ethereum", "chainId": 1, "tokenAddress": "0x33349B282065b0284d756F0577FB39c158F935e6", "token": "MPL", "tokenName": "Maple", "tokenNameLower": "maple", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14097/thumb/photo_2021-05-03_14.20.41.jpeg?1620022863", "tokenDescription": "Maple is a blockchain-based capital marketplace that aims to redefine the way businesses access funding.

The network uses the Plasma Childchain architecture, called MoreViable Plasma, which groups transactions off-chain into a merkle tree before periodically sending a \"root hash\" containing the transactions to the Ethereum mainnet. This allows the transactions to be verified in batches instead of individually, resulting in faster speeds and significantly lower-cost transactions than using Ethereum directly.\n\nThe OMG Network is run by its parent organization, Omise, a company that facilitates cross-border payments within Southeast Asia. The network utilizes the OMG utility token as one of the payment methods for fees on the OMG Network and it will also be used for staking in OMG's Proof-of-Stake system. This allows users to help secure the network in return for rewards.\n\nThe OMG Network is led by a team of over 50 employees in various locations across the world, with the current CEO being Vansa Chatikavanij. The platform is supported by $25 million in funding obtained by selling OMG coins during its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO) by founders Jun Hasegawa and Donnie Harinsut. Additionally, OMG Network's parent firm SYNQA raised a further $80 million in Series C funding and was supported by several major investment firms, including Toyota Financial Services Corporation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.\n\nWhat makes OMG Network unique is its belief that Ethereum's significant speed and cost barriers will need to be overcome before mainstream businesses and people will consider building their cryptocurrency products and applications on the Ethereum network. By implementing Plasma, OMG Network aims to get rid of unnecessary data in the root chain and handle smart contracts much like its foundation, Ethereum, but will only broadcast completed transactions to the public Ethereum chain, saving an enormous amount of processing power and memory for the chain's participants and reducing the cost to interact with the system's other participants.\n"}, {"chain": "ethereum", "chainId": 1, "tokenAddress": "0x8207c1FfC5B6804F6024322CcF34F29c3541Ae26", "token": "OGN", "tokenName": "Origin Protocol", "tokenNameLower": "origin protocol", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/3296/thumb/op.jpg?1547037878", "tokenDescription": "Origin Protocol is a decentralized platform that enables the creation of peer-to-peer marketplaces.

The protocol is designed to eliminate the need for trusted intermediaries, with a focus on decentralization, censorship resistance, and security. Quickswap is open-source software that is licensed under the GPL.\n\nEach Quickswap smart contract, or pair, manages a liquidity pool made up of reserves of two ERC-20 tokens. Anyone can become a liquidity provider (LP) for a pool by depositing an equivalent value of each underlying token in return for pool tokens. These tokens track pro-rata LP shares of the total reserves and can be redeemed for the underlying assets at any time.\n\nPairs act as automated market makers, standing ready to accept one token for the other as long as the \u201cconstant product\u201d formula is preserved. This formula, most simply expressed as x * y = k, states that trades must not change the product (k) of a pair\u2019s reserve balances (x and y). Because k remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the invariant. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones.\n\nIn practice, Quickswap applies a 0.30% fee to trades, which is added to reserves. As a result, each trade actually increases k. This functions as a payout to LPs, which is realized when they burn their pool tokens to withdraw their portion of total reserves. In the future, this fee may be reduced to 0.25%, with the remaining 0.05% withheld as a protocol-wide charge.\n\nOverall, Quickswap's algorithm ensures that the relative price of the two pair assets can only be changed through trading, creating arbitrage opportunities, and ensuring that Quickswap prices always trend toward the market-clearing price. It is an innovative approach to liquidity provision and trading on the Ethereum blockchain.\n"}, {"chain": "ethereum", "chainId": 1, "tokenAddress": "0x31c8EAcBFFdD875c74b94b077895Bd78CF1E64A3", "token": "RAD", "tokenName": "Radicle", "tokenNameLower": "radicle", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/14013/thumb/radicle.png?1614402918", "tokenDescription": "Radicle is a decentralized network for software development collaboration.

However, Tellor enables users to have all the data they need in one place, through Ethereum-based smart contracts with Tellor oracle feeds. Oracles source real-time, available, reliable, and verified information, so users have access to valid market data without visiting a crypto exchange.\n\nTellor works by hosting the network on the Ethereum network and representing an oracle network that feeds Ethereum-based smart contracts off-chain data. It acts as a medium between smart contracts on Ethereum by connecting them to off-chain data and creating trustless feeds for users on the network. This allows smart contracts to connect to on-chain data banks created and backed by staked miners.\n\nTo provide trustless and secure information, Tellor relies on the network of interconnected staked miners who work on solving problems, i.e. mathematical equations, to confirm and validate information feeds for requested data types. The protocol underpinning this mechanism is the Proof of Work consensus. This ensures that the potential manipulation of data that is sourced off-chain is prevented, while the data feeds are updated by Tellor\u2019s smart contracts every 5 minutes.\n\nThe TRB token, also known as Tributes, is the utility token of the Tellor system.

This is achieved through a system of smart contracts and the decentralized participants who are incentivized to perform maintenance and governance functions. Dai is regulated by MakerDAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) composed of the owners of its governance token, MKR. These token holders can propose and vote on changes to certain parameters in the smart contracts in order to ensure the stability of Dai.\n\nDai is created from an overcollateralized loan and repayment process facilitated by MakerDAO's smart contracts. Users who deposit Ether or other accepted cryptocurrencies as collateral are able to borrow against the value of their deposits and receive newly generated Dai. The minimum collateralization ratio for Ether is currently set at 150%, which means that for every $150 worth of Ether deposited, one can borrow up to 100 Dai (worth roughly $100).\n\nIf the collateralization ratio of a loan falls below the minimum ratio, anyone can call a function on the contract to liquidate the loan and receive a percentage of the collateral as a reward. Upon repayment of the loan and its accrued interest, the returned Dai is automatically destroyed, and the collateral is made available for withdrawal. In this way, the USD value of Dai can be said to be backed by the USD value of the underlying collateral held by MakerDAO's smart contracts.\n\nMakerDAO is able to control the amount of Dai in circulation and its value by controlling the types of accepted collateral, minimum collateralization ratios, and the interest rates for borrowing or storing Dai. The power to propose and implement changes to these variables is granted to holders of the MKR token, who can vote on proposed modifications in proportion to the amount of tokens they hold.\n\nMakerDAO was formed in 2014 by Danish entrepreneur Rune Christensen, and officially launched on the main Ethereum network in December 2017. In 2018, venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz invested $15 million in MakerDAO by purchasing 6% of all MKR tokens. MakerDAO's goal is to create a decentralized, community-governed platform for creating and managing Dai, and to promote its use as a global, neutral, and stable store of value.\n"}, {"chain": "optimism", "chainId": 10, "tokenAddress": "0x65559aA14915a70190438eF90104769e5E890A00", "token": "ENS", "tokenName": "Ethereum Name Service", "tokenNameLower": "ethereum name service", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/19785/thumb/acatxTm8_400x400.jpg?1635850140", "tokenDescription": "Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a blockchain-based naming system that simplifies the process of identifying blockchain addresses.

DAI is essentially digital currency that maintains its purchasing power because its value is stabilized against the US dollar. Maker is able to achieve this with the help of its unique smart contracts known as Collateralized Debt Positions.\n\nThe platform enables anyone to leverage their Ethereum assets to generate DAI. Once they have this collateral-backed cryptocurrency, users can freely send it to others, use DAI to pay for goods and services or hold it as a long-term investment. The platform has two different official coins \u2013 the Makercoin (MKR) and the Dai Stablecoin (DAI). The Makercoin is used to govern the platform as a whole, while DAI is designed for payments, savings and collaterals and maintains a very stable price.\n\nDAI is created to ensure MKR is protected from immense market volatility and huge price fluctuations. Its value is pegged to the US dollar, meaning 1 DAI = 1 USD. As a decentralized stablecoin, DAI lends itself particularly well to four key markets: the financial market, gambling market, transparent accounting systems and international trade.\n\nUnlike DAI, MKR is not a stablecoin and therefore has a volatile price. The coin plays a crucial role in the platform\u2019s ecosystem and supply mechanics. It has three main roles on the platform: it acts as a utility token, governance token and a recapitalization resource. MKR is used to pay various fees associated with generating DAI.

The supply of MKR is correlated with the demand for DAI.\n\nIn summary, Maker is a smart contract platform built on the Ethereum blockchain that aims to solve volatility issues for the crypto market. Its most impressive product so far is the DAI stablecoin, which is soft-pegged to the US dollar and has no volatility. It has a dual coin system, the Makercoin (MKR) and the Dai Stablecoin (DAI) which play different roles in the ecosystem.

Wrapped Bitcoin is one of many wrapped cryptocurrencies created as a solution to this issue: It lets BTC holders \u201cwrap\u201d their Bitcoin and create a token compatible with Ethereum\u2019s protocol so it can communicate and transact with a different blockchain. Wrapped Bitcoin allows applications and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain to interact with cryptocurrency that is backed by real Bitcoin reserves. When users exchange BTC for wBTC, the original Bitcoin is stored in a digital vault, and newly minted wBTC is then released to the user. Wrapped Bitcoin is redeemable on a one-to-one basis with BTC, which means users can wrap or unwrap Bitcoin whenever they choose. Generally, exchanges will charge a small fee for these transactions, so check the fee to wrap or unwrap a cryptocurrency before making a transaction.\n"}, {"chain": "arbitrum", "chainId": 42161, "tokenAddress": "0x6314C31A7a1652cE482cffe247E9CB7c3f4BB9aF", "token": "1INCH", "tokenName": "1inch", "tokenNameLower": "1inch", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13469/thumb/1inch-token.png?1608803028", "tokenDescription": "1inch is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator that scans multiple DEXs to find the lowest cryptocurrency prices for traders.

Players can breed and battle with these Axies within the game. Sky Mavis charges a 4.25% fee to players when they trade Axies on its marketplace. In September 2021, most Axie Infinity players were from the Philippines.\n\nThe game is built on the Ronin Network, an Ethereum-linked sidechain developed by Sky Mavis. The game's official cryptocurrency is \"Axie Infinity Shards/Token\" or AXS for short. The game's secondary token, SLP, crashed in February 2022 amid a wider NFT and cryptocurrency crash, losing over 99% of its peak value. In March 2022, the Ronin Network was hacked, resulting in the theft of approximately US$620 million worth of cryptocurrency from the project. The hackers were linked to Lazarus Group, a group funded by North Korea.\n\nAccording to the company's website, Axie Infinity is a competitive game with an \"idle battle\" system derived from games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Idle Heroes. The game has an in-game economy where players can buy, sell, and trade resources they earn in the game. Sky Mavis marketed the game with a \"play-to-earn\" model, where players can earn an Ethereum-based in-game cryptocurrency by playing the game. However, this model has been criticized as a form of gambling and an unstable market that is overly reliant on the inflow of new players.\n\nIn the Philippines, the prohibitive cost of entry led to individuals and gaming guilds renting out assets to allow new players to meet the minimum requirements. These new players, known as \"scholars\", are often required to meet a quota of in-game earning to continue using the rented assets, and must pay the owners a commission. This commission can be as high as 75%. As of June 2021, some people in the Philippines had begun to treat the game as their main source of income, although earning rates from playing Axie Infinity fell below the national minimum wage by September 2021.\n"}, {"chain": "arbitrum", "chainId": 42161, "tokenAddress": "0xBfa641051Ba0a0Ad1b0AcF549a89536A0D76472E", "token": "BADGER", "tokenName": "Badger DAO", "tokenNameLower": "badger dao", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/13287/thumb/badger_dao_logo.jpg?1607054976", "tokenDescription": "Badger DAO is a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that aims to provide infrastructure for the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) ecosystem.

It is a decentralized platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for startups and organizations looking to add live or on-demand video to their offerings. The protocol's main focus is on video transcoding, which refers to the reformatting of a video to suit a variety of bandwidths and devices. The network's native token is the Livepeer Token (LPT).\n\nThe core idea behind Livepeer is to offer a scalable and cost-effective infrastructure solution that can meet today's high demand for streaming. Video streaming is extremely costly on the computing side, largely because video distributors must first transcode the video before broadcasting it. The resulting costs have meant that many video streaming companies have resorted to selling user data and subjecting users to ads to earn revenue to pay their infrastructure bills. Livepeer aims to replace this model by offering a decentralized, token-incentivized, and open network that can reduce costs up to 50x compared to legacy methods.\n\nThe process of Livepeer works in the following way: Nodes called Broadcasters send video streams to the network for transcoding. These streams are received by Orchestrators, who contribute their computer's CPU, GPU, and bandwidth to the network in exchange for fees denominated in ether (ETH) charged to Broadcasters. The work is distributed to Orchestrators in proportion to the amount of LPT they have staked. The Transcoders that perform the work are often GPUs that are mining digital currencies, but also happen to have video encoding ASICs sitting idle during the mining process. This enables these ASICs to be put to use, driving additional revenue for the operators, all without disrupting their mining operations.\n\nLivepeer utilizes a two-layer consensus mechanism. The first layer is the Livepeer ledger and its transactions are recorded on and secured by the Ethereum blockchain. The second consensus layer handles the distribution of newly generated LPT and verifies that transcoding work has been done correctly. This layer utilizes a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) model in which Orchestrators act as validators.\n"}, {"chain": "arbitrum", "chainId": 42161, "tokenAddress": "0x46d0cE7de6247b0A95f67b43B589b4041BaE7fbE", "token": "LRC", "tokenName": "LoopringCoin V2", "tokenNameLower": "loopringcoin v2", "tokenURI": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustwallet/assets/master/blockchains/ethereum/assets/0xBBbbCA6A901c926F240b89EacB641d8Aec7AEafD/logo.png", "tokenDescription": "The Loopring protocol token, LRC, has been a part of the protocol for over 3 years and its design and usage have remained largely the same.

However, the new token model rewards LRC holders who use their assets productively for the good of the platform. Protocol fee distribution is configurable by the forthcoming Loopring DAO, but will initially be distributed to participants in the following manner: liquidity providers, insurers, and voters.

MKR is used to pay various fees associated with generating DAI.\n\nThe Maker platform makes use of its unique smart contract system called Collateralized Debt Positions (CDP). To generate DAI, users must deposit collateral assets, which are then held by CDPs. During the DAI generation process, a user also accrues debt. This debt is what effectively locks user\u2019s deposited collateral assets inside the CDP until the point when user is able to repay the debt and withdraw its collateral. It\u2019s worth noting that the value of collateral assets is always higher than the value of DAI generated (and the value of debt accrued).\n\nIn summary, Maker's most impressive product so far is the DAI stablecoin. DAI's value is pegged to the US dollar, which eliminates volatility in the crypto market, making it a more mainstream payment method. The platform's dual coin system includes the Makercoin (MKR) which is used to govern the platform and the Dai Stablecoin (DAI) which is designed for payments, savings and collaterals. The Maker platform's unique smart contract system, Collateralized Debt Positions (CDP) enables users to generate DAI by depositing collateral assets. This system also allows users to repay debt and withdraw collateral assets. Overall, Maker aims to bring stability to the crypto market and increase adoption of blockchain-based payments.\n"}, {"chain": "arbitrum", "chainId": 42161, "tokenAddress": "0x8f5c1A99b1df736Ad685006Cb6ADCA7B7Ae4b514", "token": "MLN", "tokenName": "Melon", "tokenNameLower": "melon", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/605/thumb/melon.png?1547034295", "tokenDescription": "Melon is a cryptocurrency that utilizes blockchain technology to enable users to trade and manage their digital investments.

Melon's native token is called MLN.\n\nOne of the main benefits of Melon is that it allows users to invest in different digital asset management strategies. Users can invest in the portfolios of others, or have others invest in their own portfolio. Trades and processing fees are paid for with the Melon token. Another way to use Melon is by purchasing and investing in the MLN token and storing it in a wallet. The MLN token can then be used as a currency to buy other blockchain tokens on the cryptocurrency market.\n\nTo buy Melon, you first need to purchase Ether, the token for Ethereum. This can be done through popular exchanges such as Coinbase or Cex.io. Once you have Ether, you will need a wallet to store the MLN token in, such as Myetherwallet. You can then use an exchange site like Changelly or Kraken to exchange your Ether for MLN tokens. The MLN tokens will then appear in your Myetherwallet address. To turn Melon into cash, you can reverse the process by exchanging the MLN token back to Ethereum and then selling it for fiat currency.\n"}, {"chain": "arbitrum", "chainId": 42161, "tokenAddress": "0x53236015A675fcB937485F1AE58040e4Fb920d5b", "token": "NCT", "tokenName": "PolySwarm", "tokenNameLower": "polyswarm", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/2843/thumb/ImcYCVfX_400x400.jpg?1628519767", "tokenDescription": "PolySwarm is a decentralized threat intelligence market that is powered by blockchain technology.

The exchange currently supports over 11,700 currency pairs, and the total value locked (TVL) in the exchange at the time of writing is $2.28 billion. TVL is the sum of all assets deposited in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols.\n\nStaking is a process in which Sushi users worldwide deposit currency with the exchange to facilitate trade. A portion of the transaction fee goes to the depositors as an incentive to keep funds on the exchange. Unlike centralized exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini, SushiSwap is not a custodian of deposited funds and instead acts as a facilitator.\n\nSushiSwap was created as a copy of Uniswap, the top decentralized exchange that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. In late 2021, the price of Sushi tokens dropped due to news of developers leaving the project, but the situation improved in December 2021 when developer Daniele Sestagalli proposed that Avalanche take over the network.\n\nThe future of SushiSwap is uncertain. It may be acquired by a larger project or fall in the rankings as more successful projects emerge. However, if the SushiSwap community can maintain its goals of being an expanding exchange with low costs and easy cryptocurrency swaps, it has the potential to grow.\n"}, {"chain": "arbitrum", "chainId": 42161, "tokenAddress": "0x1bCfc0B4eE1471674cd6A9F6B363A034375eAD84", "token": "SYN", "tokenName": "Synapse", "tokenNameLower": "synapse", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/18024/thumb/syn.png?1635002049", "tokenDescription": "Synapse is a community-driven platform that aims to revolutionize the world of crypto-investments through its optimized DeFi protocols.

If the collateralization ratio of a loan falls below the minimum ratio, anyone may call a function on the contract to liquidate the loan and receive a percentage of the collateral as a reward.\n\nUpon repayment of the loan and its accrued interest, the returned Dai is automatically destroyed, and the collateral is made available for withdrawal. In this way, the USD value of Dai can be said to be backed by the USD value of the underlying collateral held by MakerDAO's smart contracts.

It is provided on blockchain networks that run open-source software, in contrast to cryptocurrency exchanges that are run by centralized companies. Changes to the protocol are voted on by the owners of a native cryptocurrency and governance token called UNI, and then implemented by a team of developers. UNI coins were initially distributed to early users of the protocol.\n\nUniswap uses liquidity pools to fulfill orders instead of relying on market makers, with an aim to create more efficient markets. Individuals and bots, termed \"liquidity providers,\" provide liquidity to the exchange by adding a pair of tokens to a smart contract which can be bought and sold by other users according to the constant-product rule. In return, liquidity providers are given a percentage of the trading fees earned for that trading pair. For each trade, a certain amount of tokens is removed from the pool for an amount of the other token, thereby changing the price. No fees are required to list tokens, which allow a large amount of Ethereum tokens to be accessible, and no registration is required for users. As open-source software, Uniswap's code can also be forked to create new exchanges.\n"}, {"chain": "polygon", "chainId": 137, "tokenAddress": "0xc2132D05D31c914a87C6611C10748AEb04B58e8F", "token": "USDT", "tokenName": "Tether USD", "tokenNameLower": "tether usd", "tokenURI": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustwallet/assets/master/blockchains/ethereum/assets/0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7/logo.png", "tokenDescription": "Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency designed to provide a stable price point at all times.

It is the basis for a new-generation blockchain-based banking system that allows for faster and simpler international payments and peer-to-peer transactions. The goal of this project is to back and stabilize a collateral-backed cryptocurrency known as DAI Stablecoin.\n\nDAI is essentially digital currency that maintains its purchasing power because its value is stabilized against the US dollar. Maker is able to achieve this with the help of its unique smart contracts known as Collateralized Debt Positions. The platform enables anyone to leverage their Ethereum assets to generate DAI. Once they have this collateral-backed cryptocurrency, users can freely send it to others, use DAI to pay for goods and services or hold it as a long-term investment.\n\nThe Maker platform has two different official coins \u2013 the Makercoin (MKR) and the Dai Stablecoin (DAI). The Makercoin is used to govern the platform as a whole, while DAI is designed for payments, savings and collaterals and maintains a very stable price. The DAI was created to ensure MKR is protected from immense market volatility and huge price fluctuations. Its value is pegged to the US dollar, meaning 1 DAI = 1 USD. As a decentralized stablecoin, DAI lends itself particularly well to four key markets: the financial market, gambling market, transparent accounting systems and international trade.\n\nUnlike DAI, MKR is not a stablecoin and therefore has a volatile price. The coin plays a crucial role in the platform\u2019s ecosystem and supply mechanics. It has three main roles on the platform: it acts as a utility token, governance token and a recapitalization resource. MKR is used to pay various fees associated with generating DAI. Each time fees are paid, MKR is burnt, removing it from the chain. The supply of MKR is correlated with the demand for DAI. Holders of MKR also get the right to vote on risk management and business logic of the Maker system.\n\nThe Maker platform makes use of its unique smart contract system called Collateralized Debt Positions (CDP). To generate DAI, users must deposit collateral assets, which are then held by CDPs. During the DAI generation process, a user also accrues debt. This debt is what effectively locks user\u2019s deposited collateral assets inside the CDP until the point when user is able to repay the debt and withdraw its collateral.\n\nMaker\u2019s most impressive product so far is the DAI stablecoin. In short, one DAI equals one US dollar. Maker\u2019s DAI is also unlike other stablecoin, Maker\u2019s DAI is soft-pegged, meaning that DAI can be moved to any other fiat currency should the US economy nosedive. Overall, Maker aims to create a decentralized stablecoin that can be used in everyday transactions and as a store of value, helping to bring crypto mainstream."}, {"chain": "polygon", "chainId": 137, "tokenAddress": "0x53E0bca35eC356BD5ddDFebbD1Fc0fD03FaBad39", "token": "LINK", "tokenName": "ChainLink Token", "tokenNameLower": "chainlink token", "tokenURI": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trustwallet/assets/master/blockchains/ethereum/assets/0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA/logo.png", "tokenDescription": "Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that connects smart contracts on the blockchain with real-world data.

The Balancer protocol is governed by the Balancer (BAL) token, which can be earned via liquidity mining by depositing cryptocurrencies into Balancer\u2019s liquidity pools.\n\nAMMs are smart contracts that enable the automated management of crowd-sourced liquidity pools that furnish decentralized exchanges with tokens. Anyone is free to deposit their own tokens in an AMM liquidity pool, and receive a share of trading fees and liquidity pool tokens in return. These tokens represent an ownership share of a pool and can even be reinvested elsewhere in the DeFi ecosystem.\n\nBalancer can be compared to a weighted index fund in traditional finance. Index funds are investment strategies that focus on holding certain balances of different assets. For example, the S&P 500 is an index that tracks the 500 largest companies on the stock market. The Balancer crypto protocol functions as a weighted index fund for the DeFi ecosystem, and can maintain portfolios of up to eight different ERC-20 tokens. Instead of manually rebalancing liquidity pools like a traditional index fund, Balancer uses its constant mean market maker equation to automatically rebalance assets within pools via algorithm every time a trade is made.\n"}, {"chain": "polygon", "chainId": 137, "tokenAddress": "0xD6DF932A45C0f255f85145f286eA0b292B21C90B", "token": "AAVE", "tokenName": "Aave", "tokenNameLower": "aave", "tokenURI": "https://assets.coingecko.com/coins/images/12645/thumb/AAVE.png?1601374110", "tokenDescription": "Aave is a decentralized cryptocurrency platform that allows users to borrow and lend crypto using smart contracts.
