The add addTokenDescription.py script reads the data/token.json file, and creates a CHAT GPT Query with
information from the first 3 Google results. (for each tokenName and token field)

This Script requires Google Chrome, since the Google Search is done via headless Chrome browser. 

To run the script


1. you can install the needed python packages using my requirements.txt file or 
check the imported packages in the python script. 

# pip install -r requirements.txt

2. update your chatGPT session token: 

Insctruction here: https://github.com/acheong08/ChatGPT/wiki/Setup
but place the value on the top of the script 

Also the requested Interval to ChatGPT can be adapted, if needed. This is the inteval between our request to CHATGPT. 

3. Run script 

python addTokenDescription.py


Please note that the success of the script is mainly depented from the load of CHATGPT (which is overloaded very often)
